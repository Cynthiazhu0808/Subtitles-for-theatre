Let me tell you now,\" },\n{ character: \"CHEN BAILU\", line: \"it's not a question of whether we allow Jin to go on living: it's a question of whether he'll allow us to go on living.\" },\n\n\n{ character: \"FANG DASHENG\", line: \"I don’t believe he’s got that much power. He’s just a person.\" },\n\n\n{ character: \"CHEN BAILU\", line: \"How’d you know he’s just A person?\" },\n\n\n{ character: \"FANG DASHENG\", line: \"Hm … Have you seen Jin?\" },\n\n\n{ character: \"CHEN BAILU\", line: \"I’m not that blessed.
