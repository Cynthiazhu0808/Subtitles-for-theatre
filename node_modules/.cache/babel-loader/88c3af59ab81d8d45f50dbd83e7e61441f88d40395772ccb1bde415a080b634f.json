From where?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" I thought Da Sheng was here.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" You say your cousin Mr. Fang?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Yes, I saw him here just now.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" You don’t mean that gentleman who starts frowning upon meeting people? Don’t you ever invite him here again! He gives me the creeps.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" But he lives here.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Right here? \"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Yes—Dasheng! Dasheng!\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" Oh, it’s you! What did you want me for?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bialu\", line:\"What are you up to? Why not come out here and mix with the others?\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" I’ve been having a chat with the Shrimp, your adopted daughter. She’s a sweet child.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" And now how about coming out here for a chat with us. Come and join us, don’t be so unkindly.\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" Oh, here’s your father, and seems your mother is here too. No, no, I’d rather talk with your adopted daughter.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" There’s just no way getting him to do anything.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" You know  Mrs. Gu ,Hu Si again hasn’t been in to the bank for work the last few days.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" I’ve talked into this issue with him and he went off in a huff. Mr. Pan, please don’t take that too seriously, he—he’s just--\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" All right, let’s talk no more about him. Look, they’ve already started working on the bank’s new building. \"}, \n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" Once they’ve got footings in they’ll finish building straight away.\"},\n {character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\"In a good position like this, we’ve only got to let it and we can guarantee a fifteen per cent interest at least. If the market improves slightly, we’ll make more than twenty or even thirty percent.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Listen to the wonderful schemes Mr. Pan’s got, Bailu. What is it that you were telling me, Mr. Pan? When the market is something-or-other, the economy is something else, you—what is it you said one should do?\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" I said, when the market is critical and the economy unstable, one should invest in estates.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" That’s it; you see, Bailu, if now I spend not on putting up building, wouldn’t my market be unstable? \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" So, Mr. Pan, you’re quite right when you had the idea of putting up this big building.\"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"Twenty percent interest, two to three thousand a month, very handy to help out with one’s pocket money.\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Mr. Pan, Mr. Zhang from the newspaper office is here.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" What’s he want with you all of a sudden.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" I asked him over so that I could ask him what’s been happening these last few days. \"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Shall I ask him to come in?\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" No, you take him to room number thirty-four. Don’t take him here.\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Ms. Chen, Mrs. Dong is here, and Ms. Liu too.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Take them all over to the other side, and tell them I’ll be there soon.\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Yes, Miss.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" Well then, Mrs. Gu, that’s settled, I’ll have your bank deposit transferred.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" I leave it all to you. Nothing will go wrong in your hands.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" Good, I’ll discuss it with you later. \"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Yueting, just a moment. Still remember what I told you?\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" What?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" That little shrimp, I want to keep her as my adopted daughter. Would you make it all right with Mr. Jin and put us in the clear.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" Sure, don’t worry, I’ll see to it.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Thank you.\"},\n{character:\"Pan Yueting\",line:\" No, no thanks. I’d be satisfied if you call me ‘daddy’ less frequently.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Bailu, I do admire you! I really don’t know how to do justice to you. You’re a masterpiece—charming, beautiful, romantic, voluptuous. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"Alone in a place like this, yet with friends everywhere. Take Mr. \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Pan, for example, he’s in line with nobody, but he says he only supports you. Mr. Pan’s a good man, a most competent man; to quote a modern phrase, he’s a ‘unique unprecedented first-class type’. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"Is there anyone to beat him, whether it’s real estate, stock or government bonds?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" That’s why I’ve put my money in his hands for him to invest for me. You see, this is the one you’ve fallen for at the first sight, you’ve hooked him, when you say yes he dare not say no, so I’d say you’re the woman with the most wonderful prospects in China.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\"I didn’t hook him, it’s he on his free will that comes to me, what can I do about it? \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Anyway, it’s a case of ‘a turtle staring at a green bean…’ Oh, no, sounds spooky…\"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"You don’t know, I’ve made in the past half year quite a few friends of new school, so I always don’t know what to say in the first place with all those new terms in my mind… \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"What I was saying just now is that, Mr. Pan is like Chevalier from The Love Parade, and you the MacDonald—you two literally rival each other, and no other pair can rival you two. \"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" You’re acquiring the gift of the gab these days. I always find it hard to think of something to say when I meet you, for you’ve exhausted all wonderful words.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" You mean that?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" I mean that.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" I feel the same myself. Ever since my husband passed away, I seem to have had my tongue unbound. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"Suddenly I’ve become cleverer and I can put my tongue to anything. But what’s the use of having a clever tongue? One still cannot hold a man’s heart with it. Now, Bailu, I’m realizing that men absolutely have no conscience. \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"{However well you treat him, it’s all wasted effort.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Why, what’s Hu Si  been up to now?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Heaven knows what he’s doing! I haven’t seen a thing of him for the past couple of days. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"I told him to come, and I’ve phoned him, written to him even gone to see him myself, but he’s never home. What can you think of a man like that after all the money I have spent on him and my lavish affection on him! \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"And now look, once he gets pissed off, he’d ignore me for days on end.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" In that case you’ve every right to ignore him in turn, and save yourself a lot of bother.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" But… no, that’s not the answer. I think that however revolutionary a woman might be, she must still have some regard for ‘submission and propriety’. So no matter how badly Hu Si treats me, I shall always have considerable affection for him.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Oh my dear! Congratulations, congrats! \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Now what?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Congrats on becoming more reasonable every day! Now fancy you’re embracing ‘submission and propriety’ when facing Hu Si !\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" What! You don’t think I’m a woman with no character or principles?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" But, my dear, you’ve got to ride in the bridal sedan-chair again and have a solemn and spectacular wedding with Hu Si if you are talking about ‘submission and propriety’ with him!\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" You mean that Hu Si and I should get married? Don’t you mention that! If he’s treating me like this even before we’re married, he’d treat me a lot worse afterwards—\"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"I ‘d be no better than an old cast-off shoe! And this modern-style marriage is of no use:\"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" if he changes his mind, he’s only got to go to a lawyer and abandon me. It’s no longer like when I married my late lamented, that no matter what he did I was still his wife! And a wife who’d been married in a bridal chair, too, so he had to behave himself and keep me and pay my bills as a lord and master should. You say divorce the wife he’d lawful wedded? \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" {That’s absolutely daydreaming! No fear of that! But now… now…Bailu, you’re a clever girl, just think about it, what’s the point of getting married? What’s the point of it?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" There’s no point in it either way. But I always thought that to make a lover into one’s husband does seem a great pity.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" That’s just what I was talking about! You see, having a meal together, or going for a dance—everything goes quite well for the couple so long as they’re not married. But once, they get married, humph—\"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"No, it can’t be done! Hu Si  can say whatever he likes about it; if he proposes to me I shall refuse. Besides, I’m afraid of him, that once we were married he’d show his true {character; and you know my eldest daughter—\"}, \n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" You mean the young lady that’s been to university?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" That’s the one.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" What about her?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" You know I’m a most free-and-easy person, most unlike my daughter, just the opposite. She’s quite intellectual, a Christian, goes in for charities, quite gives herself airs. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"But I’m not like that. Once I’d set my heart on Qiu, nothing else mattered to me; now that I’ve fallen for Hu Si I live only for him. Funny, isn’t it? My daughter’s like that when I’m like I am? Must be something to do with heredity, huh?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" But, my dear Mrs. Gu, what’s that got to do with your getting married?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Oh, right, I’ve almost forgotten when talking away. I tell you, my daughter’s dead against Hu Si —though of course I’m pretty clear that she’s afraid Hu Si  would spend all my money; and also, if I married him, you see, their ages would be… \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"well, um, there wouldn’t be much difference between their ages. Just imagine how difficult it would be to know what she should call him, and it would be rather embarrassing for me as a mother!\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\"  Well, Hu Si is treating you badly all the time, I don’t see any reason you should be so very attached to him.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" But that’s what love does to you! Of course, I do realize he’s lazy and won’t change till the day he dies, so I got Mr. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"{Pan to find him a job after much coaxing and pleading. Mr. Pan said that the business was bad, but for my sake he dismissed fifteen people—no, about twenty people, no, fifteen or twenty? Anyway, ten people or so, to squeeze him in. But what does Hu Si  do?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"  He either says that the salary is low or that the work does not interest him, and after going for a couple of days he now stopped going in regularly. Lazy, good-for-nothing, helpless—ah, poor boy, he’s born this way! If I don’t take him under my wing, who will? Ah, love! I’ve never understood what the word really meant till now.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Oh, now you understand what love is, no wonder you’ve become so clever.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" I tell you, love is when you willing give him money for him to spend and don’t mind how he squanders it—that’s what love is! Love!\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" That explains why I’m always told that love has its price. Now I’ve finally come to understand what it means.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Yes, so I’d like to ‘pay some more price’ for Hu Si I’d like to get Mr. Pan to find him a job with a film company. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"Bailu, we’re good friends, like sibling sisters, couldn’t you have a word with Mr. Pan for me? I really have no face to bother him again myself.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Oh, you mean you want him to be a film-star?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Yes, and what a hit he’d be! Don’t you see, he’s every inch a film-star: Physique, features, nose, eyes.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" But, aren’t you afraid of having other women run after him?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" No, that’s the point that I have complete faith in him. He’s incapable in all other aspects but for devotion to me—he follows me about like a little dog. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"Er, em, of course he’s not seeing me these days lately, but you can’t blame him for that. \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"He asked me for three hundred, but I wouldn’t let him have it; \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"he wanted me to buy a new car, a Chevrolet, but as I couldn’t put my hand on the money, I said no. Then he proposed to me—I’m telling you, it was the twelfth time he did so—\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"I turned down him again, so it’s no wonder he’s annoyed.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" So just think about it, find him a good position to put him in a good humor again.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" I promised him this time, that as long as he’ll become a film-star, I’ll find some way to marry him. Let me tell you all about it; \"}, \n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\"I’ve thought about it all, that we’re sure to get some really big pictures in the papers, of me, of  Hu Si , and one of both of us together, and every day the papers will report the news of our honeymoon. And also—\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Congrats, congratulations! Now you think it interesting to get married; I definitely will come to your wedding ceremony and enjoy a feast. But what about your university-trained daughter?  What are you going to do about her?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Oh, once Hu Si  become a film-star everything will be different. I’ll getHu Si , as a film-star, to go along to her charity fetes and so on and sing a romantic song or two, dance the hula, and she’ll be delighted, you see if she isn’t!\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" My dear, I’ll surely do for you. You’re so very clever, and you think about everything. I promise you, that I’ll definitely see Mr. Pan about it, and tomorrow get him a job in the film company, how about that?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Thanks! Thank you! There, didn’t I say? You are a masterpiece, no woman, before or after, can rival you, and there’s no doubt with that.\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Oh, I didn’t realize you were here, Mrs. Gu\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" What do you want?\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" I’ve come to find Miss Chen.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" For those bills in your hands?\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Yes, Miss. Mr. Pan’s paid the bills that were due yesterday for you, and he told me to bring them to you.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Just burn them for me.\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Sure, sure, but here, here are some more—\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" More?\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" I’ll tell you what they are if you—\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Can’t you see I’ve got a visitor here?\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Sorry, miss.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Bonjour!

You really do look prettier every day!\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Is that so, doctor?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Tiens! My little Lulu, this dress of yours is—\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Ravissante!\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"That’s exactly the word! You’re brilliant, you always know what I’m going to say. By the way, er, garcon!\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Wee, m’shoor? \"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Tell them in the room that I won’t be joining them for mahjong.\"},\n{character:\"Wang Fusheng\",line:\" Wee, m’shoor!\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Don’t keep frisking around like this. Sit down, won’t you?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Bon, s’il vous plait, je vous prie, excusez moi, ma cherie.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Hey you two, could you stop talking that foreign gibberish?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Oh, je m’excuse, pardonnez-moi ! I’m terribly sorry, but you see, speaking foreign language is always more convenient, I’ve really got out of the habit of speaking Chinese.\"}, \n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\" Now it’s getting better, I’ve finally remembered a bit. When I just got back, I could hardly speak a single complete sentence in Chinese. Just see how mighty foreign stuff can be.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Doctor, how very lucky you are—you’ve been to foreign countries. Ah, however mighty foreign language might be, I could not forget Chinese for my whole life! Pity me!\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Georgy, why are you all dressed up like this today?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"You have no idea what a lot of things one gets caught for working in a government office. \"}, \n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"One day it’s some ceremony or other, the next a wedding one has to attend.

Last night, I came to your suite just to—\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" What happened last night?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" That’s all right.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"All right, you say?

I saw him the other day at the club wandering about with a—\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" A what?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Wandering about with a dog.\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" The callous creature without conscience. He’d rather hang around with a dog than me.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Why, have you two fallen out again? Then what’s he doing sitting outside in a car?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" What? He’s outside? At the gate?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"That’s odd! Didn’t you know? \"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Doctor, you really don’t act like a well-educated man. Why didn’t you tell me before?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"I don’t see education is any guarantee of being able to divine your wish to see Hu Si, isn’t it?\"},\n{character:\"Mrs. Gu\",line:\" Well, I can’t stop here arguing with you, I must be off.

Au—’voir !\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Whew! Finally got rid of the old hag. Bailu, I must tell you the good news. \"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" What good news? Your wife gave birth to another son for you?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Pah! You’re impossible. \"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Then you must have been promoted.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"It amounts to much the same thing as promotion. I’m telling you, I got a divorce from my wife yesterday afternoon, a proper divorce!\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" A divorce? Why, he’s given you three children, and now you’re leaving them?\"}, \n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" She’s been raising the children to free you of the worries and be focused on your doctoral degree, how could you divorce her as soon as you get back?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"What do you mean? I’ve paid her; I’ve got money and I’ve made her proper settlement. I didn’t expect that you’re acting like not knowing the ways of the world.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" True, so that’s why I need to learn from you now what ‘the ways of the world’ means.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"No, Lulu, we’re not talking about her.

Juste ciel! You must be God himself, the way you can guess whatever is going on in my mind! \"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" What? You—\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"No, Lulu, you must pity on me, a man who has just divorced and has no one to love him. You’ve got to say yes.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" You mean that when you came here and made that scene last night, sick all over my bed, you mean you’d come to propose to me?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"That was because I was drunk.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" I’m well aware of that.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"That was because I was so overjoyed! I, I just couldn’t get over the realization that I was going to be the happiest and luckiest man in the world, because I knew you’d definitely marry me.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" How weird! Why should you men be so very confident about yourselves?\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Lulu, I’ve got a house in Guangdong Road, I’ve some shares in the Da Xing Mines, and I’ve several thousands in cash in the Da Feng Bank, and of course you know I’m still in the government service.\"}, \n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"Later on, should my luck hold, there wouldn’t be the slightest difficulty in securing an income of three or four thousand dollars a month.

Open the window, quickly.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"What for?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" I want to breathe some fresh air. There’s an awful fug in here all of a sudden.\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" Fug?\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Why, yes, can’t you smell it?\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" In the room. The kid is lovable; I really like her.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Take her away, will you?\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" Sure, why, I happen to want a little sister like this.\"},\n{character:\"Chen Bailu\",line:\" Then I’ll give her to you.\"},\n{character:\"Fang Dasheng\",line:\" Thank you! Then that’s settled.\"},\n{character:\"Georgy Zhang \",line:\"I say, Bailu. You… you, aren’t you going to introduce me?
